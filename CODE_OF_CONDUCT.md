# ⚡ ASCII FORGE CODE OF CONDUCT ⚡

> *"Structure in community mirrors structure in code—both require precision and purpose."*

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 📋 Purpose & Scope - Interaction Framework

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This code establishes precise parameters for ASCII Forge ecosystem interactions. It applies universally across all project vectors: repositories, issue trackers, documentation, and communication channels. Like well-crafted functions, these standards have clear inputs, processes, and outputs—with zero ambiguity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🧬 Core Principles - Structural DNA

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- **Contextual Integrity** — Each contribution serves exactly one purpose, completely
- **Structure as Control** — Organization itself enforces functional boundaries
- **Exhaustive But Concise** — Everything necessary, nothing more
- **Humor as Cognitive Leverage** — Wit that illuminates rather than distracts
- **Self-Awareness as Foundation** — Continuous improvement through reflection

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## ✅ Expected Behaviors - Operational Parameters

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 🛠️ Technical Excellence

- Write code where every character earns its place—no excess, no waste
- Document with structural precision—future-you has memory allocation issues
- Test edge cases systematically—bugs appear exactly when ignored
- Review code like a compiler with empathy—specific, factual, actionable

### 🔄 Collaborative Dynamics

- Provide context with surgical precision—ambiguity wastes cycles
- Respect time complexity—O(1) is the only acceptable value for meetings
- Pattern-match knowledge for reuse—solve problems once, apply solutions everywhere
- Process feedback systematically—transform critique into improvement

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## ❌ Unacceptable Patterns - Exception Conditions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- **Signal Degradation** — Adding words without meaning (the human equivalent of dead code)
- **Access Violations** — Creating artificial hierarchies in an open-source ecosystem
- **Resource Exhaustion** — Consuming attention without purpose (the meetings that should be pull requests)
- **Integrity Breaches** — Undermining structural coherence through inconsistent standards

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 📣 Issue Resolution - Correction Pipeline

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **🔍 Detection** — Log violation with ISO 8601 timestamp precision
2. **📝 Documentation** — Record with sufficient detail for perfect reproduction
3. **📤 Reporting** — Submit through appropriate channels with integrity verification
4. **🔧 Resolution** — Execute appropriate response with minimal latency

Report violations to: <lloyd.handyside@neuroforge.io> or <syntheticeidos@gmail.com>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🛡️ Enforcement Matrix - Response Framework

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

| Severity | Initial Response | Repeated Pattern | Recovery Path |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| 🟢 Minor | Private correction | Temporary access limitation | Immediate upon acknowledgment |
| 🟠 Moderate | Formal warning | Extended participation restriction | Requires verification steps |
| 🔴 Critical | Immediate restriction | Permanent removal | Appeal process with strict criteria |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 👁️ Maintainer Protocol - Oversight Engine

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Maintainers execute these responsibilities:

- Respond to reports within 48 hours (24h for severity:critical)
- Recuse from cases with conflict-of-interest flags set to TRUE
- Protect reporter privacy with end-to-end encryption
- Apply standards with algorithmic consistency across all project vectors

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🌐 Attribution & Evolution - Structural Adaptation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This Code adapts elements from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) (v2.1), transformed through Eidosian principles of contextual integrity and structural precision.

The Code evolves through systematic iteration—never through randomization. Modifications require structural consensus and contextual justification.
